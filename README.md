# Kiosk-Model

# A Multi-threaded Theater Kiosk System

This program was originally written by my Operating Systems professor,Jisoo Yang, but needed to be modified to work with 10 threads as a class project. 

This program handles the flow of a limited amount of tickets to be admitted into a theater. There are 10 kiosks that allows for specific amount of tickets to be purchased, however there are a limited amount of tickets. The primary goal is to not exceed the amount of tickets within every kiosk, so the seats don't get overfilled. 

The program has already been compiled using gcc inside Linux. The easiest way to run the program is to just execute both binary oshow and patrons files at the same time within the terminal window.
